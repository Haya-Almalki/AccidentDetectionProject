# Accident Detection Project
This is a capstone project for Zeham Management Bootcamp.
## Overview:
Traffic congestion is a major issue in rapidly growing cities like Riyadh, with traffic accidents being a key contributor. These accidents not only cause delays but also pose safety risks and strain emergency response times. Our project aims to develop an automatic accident detection system using on-road surveillance cameras and the YOLO model to detect incidents in real time. The system categorizes accidents as either “accident” or “severe” and immediately alerts authorities for quick action. This project aligns with Saudi Arabia’s Vision 2030, supporting smart city development and improved road safety and traffic management.
## Dashboard:
We surveyed Riyadh residents to understand how accidents affect daily traffic flow. The survey explored residents' perceptions of congestion caused by accidents and its impact on the city’s transportation network. Results findings are presented in a dashboard, offering a clear visualization of respondents' feedback.
